# College-Projects

Although long ago it was an unforgettable class with Dr. Lee Koh the destroyer of trees. The class focused on the low level language of MIPS and how common c++ commands were broken down. Among this folder are my projects that I completed during his class. As most of the projects were written for MIPS I included the MARS.jar file needed to run most of the programs.

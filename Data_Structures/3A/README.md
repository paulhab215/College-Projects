Project 3A – Problem and Description

In this portion of Project 3 the task was to input an arithmetic expression (1), convert it to postfix and print the postfix (2). It was also meant to be repeated 5 times.

-	This task was accomplished by asking the using to enter in the expression to be translated to postfix expression:
-	Then declare a space for the variable on the stack and loop through the expression placing the values of the expression onto the stack.  There was a specific function for dealing with operators. After taking care of the operators it pops the expression to the screen in the order that it appears on the stack.

Project 3A – Input and Output
 
Enter the infix expression : 3*X+(Y-12)-Z
 
Length of string : (3*X+(Y-12)-Z) is 12
 
3X*Y12-Z-+
 
Enter the infix expression : 5+9+7
 
Length of string : (5+9+7) is 5
 
597++
 
Enter the infix expression : (7+(3*5))-4
 
 
Length of string : ((7+(3*5))-4) is 11
 
735*+4- 
 
Enter the infix expression : 3-5+7*4
 
Length of string : (3-5+7*4) is 7
 
3574*+-
 
 
Enter the infix expression : (2+3)*7
 
Length of string : ((2+3)*7) is 7
